# Open Similar package for Atom text editor

Open files with the same filename but different file extensions in the same directory with a simple hotkey!
This package is very useful when working with Angular 2's file naming convention.

Example use folder structure:

-`componentFolder`
|-`my.component.ts`
|-`my.component.html`
|-`my.component.css`

If you're working on `my.component.html` and you want to quickly open `my.component.ts` and `my.component.css`, without digging through your filetree, this is the package for you.
